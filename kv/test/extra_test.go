// Like previous labs, you must write some tests on your own.
// Add your test cases in this file and submit them as extra_test.go.
// You must add at least 5 test cases, though you can add as many as you like.
//
// You can use any type of test already used in this lab: server
// tests, client tests, or integration tests.
//
// You can also write unit tests of any utility functions you have in utils.go
//
// Tests are run from an external package, so you are testing the public API
// only. You can make methods public (e.g. utils) by making them Capitalized.
